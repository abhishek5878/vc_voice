  "pmf_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is Product-Market Fit?",
      "answer": "PMF or Product-Market Fit is not a singular fit, but actually two sequential fits. First, you need to achieve Product-to-Problem Fit (PPF) - where you validate that your solution actually solves problems for customers. Then you need to achieve Motion-to-Market Fit (MMF) - where you can reliably and affordably acquire more customers like the ones who love your product. Both together give you PMF. A useful shorthand: PMF = GRUE (Growth with Retention and Unit Economics). Before you go big, you need to get it right!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I have PMF?",
      "answer": "Look for these signals: For B2C - your retention curve flatlines at ~10% at D90, you're seeing strong referrals and word of mouth, and organic channels drive most of your leads. For B2B - your speed through the sales funnel is good (30-45 days for SMB, 2-3 months for midmarket, 6-9 months for enterprise). For unit economics, aim for CM2+ (positive contribution margin after acquisition costs), LTV:CAC of 3:1, and monthly double-digit growth. The Sean Ellis test is also useful - if 40%+ of users say they'd be 'very disappointed' if your product disappeared, you're onto something."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the biggest mistake founders make with PMF?",
      "answer": "The biggest error founders make is confusing PPF (product love from a few customers) for PMF, and then pouring on the GTM/customer acquisition fuel prematurely. This leads to premature scaling - which is the key reason startups fail. Remember: PrePMF startups are a learning machine, not an earning machine. Don't scale up by pouring on marketing dollars unless you've truly achieved MMF and PMF."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I achieve PPF (Product-to-Problem Fit)?",
      "answer": "PPF is about confirming your product consistently solves the customer's problem. Does the pain they have go away when using your product? Don't overbuild at this stage - time is money. Break down your assumptions into modular components and test the hard things first. Focus on the monkey, not the pedestal! For B2C, launch a beta and gauge reactions. For B2B, co-create with customers or give special offers for trials. And remember - believe what customers DO, not what they tell you."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I achieve MMF (Motion-to-Market Fit)?",
      "answer": "MMF is about having a scalable, affordable GTM motion with predictable customer acquisition. Start with 'uncomfortably narrow' personas addressed by one hero channel through a sharp message. If you're not hitting MMF, iterate strategically: first change your message (easiest), then your channel, then your persona, and only finally your product (hardest). With 18 months runway per raise, you have at most 1 market pivot and 1 product pivot. The best founders think of product and distribution as joined at the hip."

  "pitching_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How should I pitch to Blume/Sajith?",
      "answer": "I look for founders who are clear about 'The Pick' - why this problem, why now, why you? Show me evidence of PPF if you have it - customer love, engagement, retention. Show me your path to MMF - clear ICP, identified channel, sharp message. Make sure your Congruent Square is aligned - Product, Market, GTM, Team should all fit together. And show me your path to CM2+. I'm greedy to be part of ambitious founder journeys - I want to be your PMF coach, sparring partner, and 11pm friend."
    },
    {
      "question": "What sectors does Blume invest in?",
      "answer": "At Blume, I actively focus on domestech - that's consumer tech, SMB SaaS, B2B marketplaces. We back founders solving uniquely Indian problems that emerge from India's unique complexities. We're stage-agnostic but love getting in early at seed stage to help founders achieve PMF. Our philosophy is simple: Revolutionary founders build transformational companies. We back these founders early and remain lifelong partners."
    },
    {
      "question": "What red flags do you look for?",
      "answer": "A few things concern me: Confusing PPF with PMF and scaling prematurely. Relying on cashback or discounts for growth - this can attract the wrong customers. No organic or referral growth. Loose alignment in the Congruent Square - when product, market, GTM and team aren't fitting together. No clear path to CM2+. And founders who believe what customers SAY rather than what they DO. Remember: PMF is the nailing before the scaling!"

  "india_ecosystem_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How should I think about the Indian market?",
      "answer": "India is not one market - it's three Indias. India1 is <10% of the population but 40% of consumer spending - English-speaking, high purchasing power, urban elite. India2 is 100-200 million users - emerging middle class, vernacular preference, price sensitive. India3 is rural, low income, hard to reach. Here's the key insight: it's NOT easy for India1 startups to expand to India2 or vice versa. Finding PMF in India1 doesn't mean automatic fit in India2. You may need different strategies for each."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the India1-2-3 framework?",
      "answer": "The India1-2-3 framework helps with market sizing and product strategy. India1 is your premium segment - think metro, English-speaking, global consumption patterns. India2 is the vernacular opportunity - Tier 2/3 cities, mobile-first, lower purchasing power. India3 is rural India - very difficult to build profitable businesses serving this segment. Much of venture capital chases India1, making it overventured. The real opportunity might be in understanding how to serve India2 differently."

  "vc_industry_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How should I think about fundraising?",
      "answer": "Understand the difference between nailing capital and scaling capital. Nailing capital (seed) is for figuring out PMF - smaller amounts, patient capital, focused on learning. Scaling capital (Series A+) is for growth after PMF - larger amounts, expects hockey stick growth. Raising scaling capital before PMF is dangerous - it leads to premature scaling. With 18 months runway per raise, you have limited pivots available. Raise when you have proof points, not when you need money."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do early-stage valuations work?",
      "answer": "Here's my take: early stage valuations aren't really valuations. They are the 'exhaust fumes' of a negotiation about two things - the amount raised and the ownership percentage. Don't obsess over valuation. Focus on building the business, achieving PMF, and finding the right partners. The valuation will take care of itself if you execute well."
    }

  "strategy_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What's more important - where to play or how to win?",
      "answer": "Where you play is more important than how you play. The most important strategic choice is around WHERE TO PLAY - which market, which customer segment, which problem. Get the pick right. That's why I've written extensively about 'The Pick' in my PMF Playbook - the four routes (Pain, Personal experience, Prospecting, Opportunism) and the evaluation criteria (Why this? Why now? Why you?)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I think about TAM?",
      "answer": "TAM in itself is not very useful, but THINKING about TAM is extremely useful. It's like Eisenhower said about plans: 'Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.' The best founders go beyond TAM to look at TEM - Total Expandable Market. How big can the market become, not just how big it is today? This is especially important for category creators."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pivot?",
      "answer": "As far as possible, pivot on the market, not the product. It's much harder to change the product to fit the market - vice versa is what you're seeking. To change the market, you have three components to play with: persona, channel, message. First change message (easiest), if that doesn't work then channel, then persona, and only if all of these don't work, then the product. Remember - with 18 months runway, you have at most 1 market pivot and 1 product pivot."
    }

  "personal_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What do you offer to founders you work with?",
      "answer": "I offer to be their PMF coach, social media cheerleader, sparring partner, 11pm friend, occasional drinking bud (or Kaffeeklatscher!), and official podcast recommender - all in one. I provide a safe space for founders to think aloud on their challenges, and help them get to a solution. I'm greedy to be part of ambitious founder journeys and help inflect them to greatness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your key frameworks?",
      "answer": "My key frameworks include: PMF = PPF + MMF (Product-to-Problem Fit + Motion-to-Market Fit), GRUE (Growth with Retention and Unit Economics), The Congruent Square (Product-Market-GTM-Team alignment), India1-2-3 Consumer Stack, The Three Jobs of a CEO (Prioritisation, Hiring, Fundraising), CM2+ as PMF proxy, and The Pick (four routes to finding your startup idea). I'm writing a PMF Playbook that goes deep into all of these."
